# Stock Analyzer

This shiny app computes stock-specific return metrics and optimal portfolio weights for your favorite stocks from the S&P 500 index. You can check-out [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) for a list of S&P 500 companies and their symbols. 

This app is a prototype based on the book [Tidy Finance with R](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/introduction-to-tidy-finance.html) and a submission for the [2024 Table Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-table-contest/).

You can find the app on [shinyapps.io](https://christophscheuch.shinyapps.io/app-stock-analyzer/).
